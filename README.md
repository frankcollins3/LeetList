Take Notes on Algorithms. Store sentences as linked lists 


ðŸ““bookmarking that the book emoji will now mean that I'm bookmarking something. 
What I really want for this app/set-of-expressions to do:

Create linked list out of handwritten notes.
Return print statements of the learnings.
Gather user input on whether or not they understand the material.

If not (i heard chatGPT has API but never used it) If not, link to the API. What I firstly thought was use (a web scraper?) 
utility-> reference online articles. if (dont learn anything from returned data from articles) -> move onto another article. 
Gather user input on whether that article taught anything. If not, grab a piece of material.

As I type this, considering having that input ask if you want to use Stackoverflow, reddit, chatGPT, or other as the source of information.
